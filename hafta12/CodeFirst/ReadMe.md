Week 12: Mastering Database Operations with the Code First Approach

In this week’s session, we delved into the intricacies of Entity Framework Core, exploring the Code First methodology to design and manage databases programmatically. This README aims to encapsulate the concepts, workflows, and tasks tackled this week, providing you with a clear roadmap to success.

Key Concepts

1. Understanding Code First

The Code First approach allows developers to focus on application code, defining database structures through C# classes. This approach offers:

High flexibility in defining models.

Reduced reliance on pre-existing databases.

Seamless migration management to evolve your schema over time.

2. Getting Started with Entity Framework Core

To harness the power of EF Core, we took the following steps:

Installing Required Packages

The necessary NuGet packages were added to enable EF Core functionality and SQL Server support.

dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

Configuring the DbContext

The DbContext class serves as the bridge between your application and the database.

public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("YourConnectionStringHere");
    }
}

3. Modeling the Database

Database tables were defined using entity classes. Here’s an example:

public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

4. Managing Migrations

Migrations were used to translate our code-based models into database schema changes.

Creating an Initial Migration:

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

Applying the Migration:

dotnet ef database update

This ensures that the database aligns with the defined models.

Project Structure

Your project should now resemble the following structure:

CodeFirst/
├── Models/
│   ├── Student.cs
├── Data/
│   ├── AppDbContext.cs
├── Migrations/
│   ├── ... (Generated migration files)
└── Program.cs

Tasks for the Week

Database Initialization with EnsureCreated

Use the DbContext.Database.EnsureCreated() method to automatically generate the database during application startup.

CRUD Operations

Implement and test Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to solidify your understanding.

Extending Models

Add a new Course model and establish relationships with Student (e.g., many-to-many relationships).

Debugging and Optimization

Address common errors, such as invalid configurations or missing references.

Common Issues and Resolutions

CS1061 Error

Ensure the object on which EnsureCreated is called derives from DbContext. Verify references to Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore are correctly added.

Connection Issues

Double-check your connection string in OnConfiguring. Ensure the database server is running and accessible.

Final Notes

This week’s exercises emphasize building a strong foundation in Code First development. By mastering these skills, you’ll be well-equipped to design efficient and maintainable databases.
