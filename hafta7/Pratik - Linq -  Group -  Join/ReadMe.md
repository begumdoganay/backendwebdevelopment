# Week 7 - Advanced LINQ Group Join Operations in Student Management System

## Project Overview
This week's project demonstrates the implementation of LINQ Group Join operations in a Student Management System. The project showcases how to effectively combine and analyze data from multiple sources using LINQ's powerful grouping capabilities.

## Features
- Advanced student and class data modeling
- Complex LINQ group join operations
- Capacity tracking for classes
- Detailed reporting system
- Email management for students
- Enrollment date tracking

## Core Components

### Student Class
```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public int ClassId { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
}
```

### Class Entity
```csharp
public class Class
{
    public int ClassId { get; set; }
    public string ClassName { get; set; }
    public string TeacherName { get; set; }
    public int Capacity { get; set; }
}
```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Extended Data Models**
   - Enhanced student information including email and enrollment date
   - Class capacity management
   - Teacher information integration

2. **Advanced LINQ Operations**
   - Group Join implementation
   - Custom result type (ClassStudentReport)
   - Ordered query results
   - Capacity status tracking

3. **Reporting System**
   - Detailed class information display
   - Student enrollment statistics
   - Capacity status monitoring
   - Teacher assignment display

## Usage Example

```csharp
var classReports = classes.GroupJoin(
    students,
    c => c.ClassId,
    s => s.ClassId,
    (class_, studentsInClass) => new ClassStudentReport
    {
        ClassName = class_.ClassName,
        TeacherName = class_.TeacherName,
        StudentCount = studentsInClass.Count(),
        StudentNames = studentsInClass.Select(s => s.StudentName).ToList(),
        Capacity = class_.Capacity
    })
    .OrderBy(r => r.ClassName);
```

## Sample Output

- Clear and organized output formatting

## Exercise Suggestions
1. Add grade tracking for students
2. Implement a waitlist system for full classes
3. Add course prerequisites
4. Create a student attendance tracking system
5. Implement a course schedule feature
