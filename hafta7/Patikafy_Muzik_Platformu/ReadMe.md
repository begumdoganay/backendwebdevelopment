// Represents a musical artist with their career details

class Artist
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string MusicGenre { get; set; }
    public int DebutYear { get; set; }
    public int AlbumSales { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"{Name} - {MusicGenre} ({DebutYear}) - {AlbumSales:N0} sales";
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("🎵 Welcome to Turkish Music Platform Analysis 🎵");
        Console.WriteLine("=============================================");

        // Initialize our artist database with the legendary Turkish musicians
        var artists = InitializeArtistDatabase();
        
        // Perform various analyses on our music database
        PerformAnalyses(artists);
    }


    // Initializes the database with Turkish music artists

    private static List<Artist> InitializeArtistDatabase()
    {
        return new List<Artist>
        {
            new Artist { Name = "Ajda Pekkan", MusicGenre = "Pop", DebutYear = 1968, AlbumSales = 20_000_000 },
            new Artist { Name = "Sezen Aksu", MusicGenre = "Turkish Folk Music / Pop", DebutYear = 1971, AlbumSales = 10_000_000 },
            // ... other artists ...
        };
    }

    // ... rest of the implementation

Key LINQ Operations Used 🔍

Where() for filtering data
OrderBy() and OrderByDescending() for sorting
First() for selecting specific records
Contains() for string matching
StartsWith() for prefix matching
