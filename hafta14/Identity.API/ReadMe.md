JWT Authentication with Identity API
A step-by-step guide to implementing a JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication system using C# and ASP.NET Core Identity. This project showcases user management and secure API access through JWT.

🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a JWT-based authentication system using ASP.NET Core Identity and Entity Framework. It includes features like user registration, login, JWT generation, and token validation for securing API endpoints.

🌟 Features
User Registration: Create users with email and password.
JWT Generation: Generate tokens for authenticated users.
Token Validation: Secure APIs with token-based authorization.
Role Management: Assign roles to users for access control.
🧑‍💻 Usage
User Model Creation
Define a User class extending from IdentityUser:

csharp

Copy
public class User : IdentityUser {
    // Additional properties can be added here
}
Database Setup
Create a DbContext that integrates with Identity:

csharp

Copy
public class AppDbContext : IdentityDbContext<User> {
    public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> options) : base(options) { }
}
JWT Generation
In your AuthController, add a login method to generate JWTs:

csharp

Copy
[HttpPost("login")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login([FromBody] LoginRequest request) {
    var user = await _userManager.FindByEmailAsync(request.Email);
    if (user == null || !await _userManager.CheckPasswordAsync(user, request.Password)) {
        return Unauthorized();
    }

    var token = GenerateJwtToken(user);
    return Ok(new { Token = token });
}

private string GenerateJwtToken(User user) {
    // Token generation logic here
}
JWT Validation
Configure JWT authentication in Startup.cs:

csharp

Copy
services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddJwtBearer(options => {
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidateLifetime = true,
            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
            IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("YourSecretKey"))
        };
    });
🛡️ How It Works
User Registration: Users can register with their email and password, which are stored securely.
Login: Users submit their credentials to the /login endpoint.
JWT Generation: Upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated containing user claims.
Secure Endpoints: Use the [Authorize] attribute to protect specific routes.
Token Validation: Each request includes the JWT in the header, validated on the server side.
