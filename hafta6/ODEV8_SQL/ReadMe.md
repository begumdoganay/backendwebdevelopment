üìñ Comprehensive README for Employee Database Management ‚ú®
üåü Introduction
Welcome to the Employee Database Management project! This README provides a detailed overview of the SQL operations performed on the employee table within a relational database. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to create a table, populate it with data using the Mockaroo service, and perform various SQL operations such as updates and deletions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide aims to be a comprehensive resource for managing employee data effectively.

üìÇ Project Overview
This project focuses on creating and managing an employee table that includes key attributes such as:

id: A unique identifier for each employee (INTEGER).
name: The full name of the employee (VARCHAR(50)).
birthday: The birth date of the employee (DATE).
email: The email address of the employee (VARCHAR(100)).
The operations performed on this table include:

Creating the table structure.
Populating the table with mock data.
Updating existing records based on specific criteria.
Deleting records as needed.
üõ†Ô∏è Database Setup
Creating the Employee Table
To start, you'll need to create the employee table with the specified columns. Below is the SQL command for table creation:

sql

Copy
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,  -- Employee ID
    name VARCHAR(50),        -- Employee Name
    birthday DATE,          -- Date of Birth
    email VARCHAR(100)      -- Email Address
);
Inserting Data
To populate the employee table, we will use the Mockaroo service to generate 50 random entries. Follow these steps:

Visit Mockaroo: Go to Mockaroo.
Define Fields: Create fields as follows:
id: Integer (auto-incremented if necessary)
name: Full Name
birthday: Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
email: Email Address
Set Rows: Specify 50 rows to generate.
Download Data: Click on Download Data to obtain a CSV file.
Load Data into the Database: Use the following command to load the CSV data into your database:
sql

Copy
LOAD DATA INFILE 'path_to_your_file.csv'
INTO TABLE employee
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;  -- Ignore header row
üîß SQL Operations
Update Operations
Updating existing records is crucial for maintaining accurate employee information. Below are examples of SQL UPDATE commands:

sql

Copy
-- Update the name of the employee with ID 1
UPDATE employee SET name = 'John Doe' WHERE id = 1;

-- Update the birthday of the employee with ID 2
UPDATE employee SET birthday = '1990-05-15' WHERE id = 2;

-- Update the email of the employee with ID 3
UPDATE employee SET email = 'jane@example.com' WHERE id = 3;

-- Update the name of the employee with ID 4
UPDATE employee SET name = 'Alice Smith' WHERE id = 4;

-- Update the birthday of the employee with ID 5
UPDATE employee SET birthday = '1985-12-01' WHERE id = 5;
Delete Operations
When employee records are no longer needed, you can remove them using the DELETE statement. Here are some examples:

sql

Copy
-- Delete the employee with ID 1
DELETE FROM employee WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete the employee with ID 2
DELETE FROM employee WHERE id = 2;

-- Delete the employee with ID 3
DELETE FROM employee WHERE id = 3;

-- Delete the employee with ID 4
DELETE FROM employee WHERE id = 4;

-- Delete the employee with ID 5
DELETE FROM employee WHERE id = 5;
üéâ Conclusion
Congratulations on completing the setup and operations for the employee database! This project not only demonstrates how to create and manage a simple employee table but also provides a solid foundation for further exploration in SQL. You can now easily add, update, and remove employee records, making your data management process efficient and straightforward.
