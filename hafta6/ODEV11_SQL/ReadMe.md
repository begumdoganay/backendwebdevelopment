üìÇ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform various SQL operations using the dvdrental sample database. The focus is on retrieving first_name data from the actor and customer tables through different SQL querying techniques.

üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema
The relevant tables in this project include:

ACTOR: Contains information about actors.
actor_id: Identifier for the actor
first_name: First name of the actor
last_name: Last name of the actor
CUSTOMER: Contains information about customers.
customer_id: Identifier for the customer
first_name: First name of the customer
last_name: Last name of the customer
üìù SQL Queries
All First Names
sql

Copy
SELECT first_name 
FROM actor 
UNION ALL 
SELECT first_name 
FROM customer 
ORDER BY first_name;
Retrieves all first names from both actor and customer tables, including duplicates.

Intersecting First Names

SELECT first_name 
FROM actor 
INTERSECT 
SELECT first_name 
FROM customer 
ORDER BY first_name;
Retrieves first names that are common to both actor and customer tables.

First Names in Actor but Not in Customer

SELECT first_name 
FROM actor 
EXCEPT 
SELECT first_name 
FROM customer 
ORDER BY first_name;
Retrieves first names that exist in the actor table but not in the customer table.

All First Names with Duplicates

SELECT first_name 
FROM actor 
UNION ALL 
SELECT first_name 
FROM customer 
ORDER BY first_name;
Retrieves all first names from both tables, including duplicates again.

Intersecting First Names with Duplicates

SELECT first_name 
FROM actor 
JOIN customer ON actor.first_name = customer.first_name 
ORDER BY actor.first_name;
Retrieves common first names from both tables, including duplicates.

First Names in Actor with Duplicates Not in Customer

SELECT first_name 
FROM actor 
LEFT JOIN customer ON actor.first_name = customer.first_name 
WHERE customer.first_name IS NULL 
ORDER BY actor.first_name;
Retrieves first names that exist in the actor table and are not found in the customer table, including duplicates.

üèÉ Running the Queries
To run these queries:

Ensure you have access to the dvdrental database.
Use a SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin) to connect to the database.
Copy and paste the desired query into the query editor.
Execute the query to view the results.
